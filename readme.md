## 2. Requirements
`python3.6`,`tensorflow=2.4`, `cityflow`, `pandas`, `numpy`

[`cityflow`](https://github.com/cityflow-project/CityFlow.git) needs a Linux environment, and we run the code on Manjaro Linux.


## 3. Quick start

For the method in our article, run the following:
```shell
python run_max_ql.py
```
```shell
python run_ql_dqn.py
```
```shell
python run_ql_frap.py
```
```shell
python run_ql_gat.py
```

For the baseline methods,
- Fixed-Time
```shell
python run_fixedtime.py
```
- Max-Pressure
```shell
python run_maxpressure.py
```
- PressLight
```shell
python run_presslight.py
```
- MPLight
```shell
python run_mplight.py
```
- FRAP
```shell
python run_frap.py
```
- Colight
```shell
python run_colight.py
```
### 3.1 Evaluate the results
Change the folder name in `summary.py` as yours, and run: 
```shell
python summary.py
```
## 4. Code details
### 4.1、structure
- `models`: contains all the models used in our article.
- `utils`: contains all the methods to simulate and train the models.

### 4.2、Reference
